

The general goal is to pull off and separate agreements that are
exhibits to EDGAR 10-K and 8-K filings into individual text
files. Scripts already exist to do the basic work, just a more
cohesive process needs to be implemented.

More specifically the following process is requested:

1. Pull of a specified index for a given year quarter - use
http://razor.occams.info/code/repo/?/govtrack/sec/getindex.sh to pull
down the index

2. In that index, connect again to the server and pull off all 10-K
and 8-K filings (can use
http://razor.occams.info/code/repo/?/govtrack/sec/getforms.pl as
starting point but it will need to be modified)

3. The parse thru the files to pull of and separate the portions of
the files that are agreements into individual files. The attached
script will parse the files and pull off the data

An example of this is as follows:

- In the 3rd Quarter of 2008, there is a file in the index named
  0000950137-04-006413.txt. The full line in the index file is as
  follows:

1024657|WEST
CORP|8-K|2004-08-09|edgar/data/1024657/0000950137-04-006413.txt

When that file is downloaded, it looks like the file here -
http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRm.1682.d.htm

In that file there are two Exhibits - Exhibit 2.1 and 2.2. Both
contain the word "Agreement" in their title. If this file was parsed,
the contents in Exhibit 2.1 would be in one resulting file and the
contents in Exhibit 2.2 would be in another file at the end. Both
files should have individualized names to make them recognizable such
as date-name (like "Purchase Agreement")-exhibit) (but can end in txt)

Any modifications to the above scripts will be released under the GNU
AGPL. Resulting script / program should run on Ubuntu 10.10.
