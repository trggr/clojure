;;Sudoku solver
;; Copied from http://www.learningclojure.com/2009/11/sudoku_24.html
;;As direct a translation as I could make of Peter Norvig's famous python solver

;;Algorithm is constraint propagation coupled with depth-first search

;;Constraint propagation is performed by mutually recursive functions modifying state
;;So in clojure we need to put our strings in atoms.


;;I split the eliminate function into two (eliminate! and check!) to make it easier to read.

;; Lessons learned during translation process

;; Lazy evaluation and mutation really don't work together very well.

;; Solver appeared to work but seemed to take infinite time on 3rd sudoku
;; Actually it took several hundred thousand iterations, but got the right answer
;; run next to python program showed that python code was getting there in a couple of hundred
;; Realised that constraints were not being propagated properly
;; Added doalls to every for
;; Now program crashes because last values have been eliminated without returning false

;; Actually we need loops with early return, otherwise we keep eliminating things from already false branches
;; Now notice that the doalls are actually making things slower because any? would have short-circuited once anything was false. Get rid of them and get a 2x speedup.
;; now running at half the speed of python
